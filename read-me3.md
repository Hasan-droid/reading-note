# css and html
## 1. The Structure of Html webpages
>The HTML code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag
has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between its opening and
closing tags.

on exmaple of that is the *paragraph element* **<p></p>**
 1. **<p>** start tag
 2.**</p>** closing tag
## 2. html layouts

>web page authors used <div> elements to group
together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a
header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes
to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.

>**HTML5** introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them.
