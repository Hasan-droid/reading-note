# What is a tect edtitor ?
>A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site

## what features should included in the text editor ?
1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available
> Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can
imagine

### 1. code completion
> n allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.

### 2. syntax highlighting
>  Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text

### 3.  themes
> will allow you to change the color of
the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text,
and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing
software as well

### 4. extensions
> Extensions are like
plugins for your text editor, that allow you to have superpowers that you wouldn’t have otherwise. 
A text editor that has a great selection of extension will ensure that you have the ability to add functionality
as you need it.

## disadvantegs of using pre-installed operating system text editor
1. you’re creating code in a plain text editor
2.  you need to  first create a folder on your computer somewhere
(maybe on your Desktop, for example) to store your entire website.
3.  they need to have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names

## third party editor
1. Notepad++
2. TextWrangler/BB Edit (retired in 2017) , , BB Edit instead cost(49$ for the full version)
3. VS Code(has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS
already built-in , VS Code has
everything:)
4. Atom (from github and it has the all 4 features)
5. Brackets (Adobe , has the all features , live perivew)
6. Sublime Text 3 (cost 70$ , ast and responsive while being extensible , has the all 4 features)

## The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs
> A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files
>An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
