# operators & loops
## 1. comparsion operators
 1. ** ==** to check if tow values are equial regradless there data type
 2. **!=** to check if tow values are *not* equila regradless there data type
 3. **===** to check if tow values are equial as well as if are they the same data type
 4. **!==** to check both the values and data type are *not* the same
## 2. logical operators
 > allows you to compare more than tow logical operators

 1. **&&** both expersions has to be true to results true
 2. ** || ** one expresion has to be true to results true
 3. **!** this results the revrsie of the logical state
## ** loops **
 1. **for ** if u need to run code a specific number of times
 2. **while** if u dont know how many times the code should run 
 3. **do while** the statments inside the curly braces will run atleast one time even if the condition was false
