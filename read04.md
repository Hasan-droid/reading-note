# Java Script 
**what is javascript**
its a code that we use inside the html page to enhance the way the pages rendres and make the website interactive with the users 
**How javascript works**
*in order to answer that we need to take a look on this*
![javaScript nodes](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ocR0a.png)
the image above is explainig how the java script deals with webpages
## 1. javascript turn the webpage into tree
the root of that tree called *document* which is the webpage itself
each webpage has three things *from javascript porint of view*
* object
* element
* Text
* Attributes
## 2. create a model of the page and store it in the memory
* at the **top** of the model is **document object** whic represnts the whole document
* **beneath the document object** there are **nodes** 
> each of these nodes represnting elements , text within elements and Attributes
### document.write('Good afternoon!')
1. **document** represents the entire webpage
2. **. (the dot) ** 
>the document object has several methods and properties.They are Known as members of that object.
>the dot **.** gives us the accebilty for those members and it called
>**member operator**
3. **write() ** 
> method of the document object allows new content to be written into the page where the *<script>* element sits
3. **('Good afternoon!') the parametes ** 
>each piece of information is called a parameter of the method.

so we can see from the previous example that javascript links directly to the webpages and make changes on it 
> javascripts change how the page behaves , adding interactivity

*by using **<script></script>** tags you are telling the browser that there is js code here in your html*
## 3. some tips before start coding
1. its better to javascript code in a seprated file
2. javascript can be written using notepad as html and css but u have to make the extension *.js*
3. where ever you place your **<Script></script>** will change the place it renders in it fromm the webpage
