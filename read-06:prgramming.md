# what is a function?
> * Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task.
> * If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function 
> *  functions also offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task
> * For example, you might have a task that you only want to
perform if the user clicks on a specific element in the page.

## how to use function ?
you need to give it a **name** , that name should describe what the function are going to do , and the you need to **call** it with that specific name 
*be aware that some function need parameters*
*some functions can be used to return values*
## how it works ?
within the **scope** of the function , the code will run every and each time you call the function
*Remember that programming  rely upon on **name/value pairs**.*
 for example :
 **updateMesage()** is a function that has a name which *updateMesage*
 and the value is the *code* within the function
 ## Decalre function 
 **function sayhello() 
{
  document . writeln("hello world")

 ## return a single value from a function 
 function calculate area (width , height)
